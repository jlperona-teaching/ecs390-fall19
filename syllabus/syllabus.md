## About the Course

### Curriculum

This is the third time that I've taught this class.
The first time, the course was designed towards getting new instructors practical teaching experience.
However, I found that instructors that already had prior teaching experience didn't find the course particularly useful for them.

To address that issue, the second time I taught this course, I heavily based the curriculum on the [*Megas and Gigas Educate (MaGE)*](https://sites.google.com/a/mtholyoke.edu/mage/) program developed at [Mount Holyoke College](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/).
As they state on their website, *MaGE* is designed to:

* raise awareness of the role of social identity in learning
* emphasize active learning within computer science
* provide preparation for being technical peer mentors

The intent behind using their curriculum was to make the course more useful for students who already have teaching experience.
However, this was somewhat *too* high-level for instructors who had no teaching experience.

Thus, this third iteration of the class will blend the two together.
We will focus on practical teaching experience in the first half of the class, then move on to some of the more important topics in the *MaGE* curriculum in the latter half.
My hope that this course will prove useful to instructors across the spectrum of prior teaching experience.

### Official Description

Participation as a Teaching Assistant or Associate-In in a designated engineering course.
Methods of leading discussion groups or lab sections, writing and grading quizzes, use of lab equipment, and grading lab reports.
May be repeated for credit.

### Objectives

1. Student will develop the skills to effectively lead responsive, informative discussion sections.
2. Student will be able to develop efficient and fair methods of grading student programs and tests.
3. Student will learn about the various resources available to student instructors on campus.

The whole point of this class is for you to improve as an instructor.
I get to improve as an instructor as well by teaching this class, so everyone wins!
It doesn't matter if you've had previous experience teaching or not, you can *always* improve your teaching and make things better.

### Academic Misconduct

Academic misconduct is a serious issue.
You can find the official UC Davis policy on the [Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs](https://ossja.ucdavis.edu/) website.

You are expected to cite all of the work you reference.
Any ideas that are not specifically yours or generally known should have a citation.
When in doubt, cite.

Any violations of this policy will result in reporting the violating student(s) to the Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs.
This can result in a 0 on the assignment or a U in the class.

### Student Support

As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation.
These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a studentâ€™s ability to participate in daily activities.
UC Davis is committed to advancing the mental health and well-being of its students.
If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available.
You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via [Student Health and Counseling Services](https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/).
In addition, you can learn about a variety of other resources for students at UC Davis on the [Pages tab of Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/wiki).

You can also contact myself to talk in private.
My email is listed [above](#instructor).

## Websites

### GitHub

GitHub will serve as the open-source repository for some of the course content, including the syllabus (this document), the schedule, any presentation notes I post, and the layout for each week's class.

I'm a big fan of making things open-source wherever possible, hence this repository.
My GitHub repository for [ECS 154A SS2 2018](https://github.com/jlperona-teaching/ecs154a-ssii18), a class I taught previously, is a good past example of that.

### Canvas

[Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850) will serve as the discussion board for the class, as well as where you'll submit your assignments and get back your grades.

Feel free to post questions on the [Discussions tab](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/discussion_topics) of Canvas.
I'll make any announcements on the [Announcements tab](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/announcements).

## Coursework

### Grading

The course is graded on a Satisfactory / Unsatisfactory (S/U) basis.
There are 30 points possible, described in more detail in the sections below.
You need at least 80% of the points possible to get an S, as is typical of S/U classes at UC Davis, which means you can miss 6 points.
Thus, if you end up missing a class or assignment once, don't worry about it.

A brief breakdown is below:

| *Category*       | *Weight* | *Explanation*                           |
|------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| Attendance       | 60%      | 9 seminars x 2 points each = 18 points  |
| Assignments      | 30%      | 9 assignments x 1 point each = 9 points |
| Track Assignment | 10%      | 3 points                                |
| **Total**        | **100%** | **30 points**                           |

### Attendance

Attendance for each class is mandatory.
Sign in sheets (or something similar) will be passed around in class each week.
This will be a course heavily based on discussion, so to get the most out of the course, you'll need to attend most weeks.
Excusing attendance for a week requires a verifiable excuse (doctor's note, etc.).

You get two points for each class you attend.
There are 9 classes, so you get 18 points from attendance.

### Weekly Assignments

In addition to the attendance, there will usually be something that you need to submit on Canvas for that week as well.
These are *usually* due at 15:00 on the following Monday, an hour before class, but check the due date carefully.
No late assignments will be accepted without a verifiable excuse (doctor's note, etc.).

Assignments will revolve around the following:

* reflection on something discussed in class that week
* reading(s) for the following week
* feedback on the course

You get one point for each assignment.
There are 9 assignments, so you get 9 points from assignments.

### Track Assignment

This is equivalent to the class project.
There's two different tracks, depending on whether or not you'll be leading discussions this quarter or not.
For discussion leaders, your assignment involves me observing one of your discussions.
If you're not leading discussions, either because you're only grading or you're not a TA this quarter, then you're going to have an alternative assignment revolving around exposing you to something new in terms of teaching.

You get three points for your track assignment.
You only need to do one of the two.

#### Track A - Discussion Observations

I will be observing one of your discussion sections sometime this quarter.
You will submit a list of when and where your discussions are in [the first assignment](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372345).

I will email you to confirm the date and time of one of your discussions.
Once we've confirmed, I'll observe that discussion and give you feedback.
You can see the style of feedback that I'll be giving in the `observations/` folder [here on GitHub](../observations).

For the observation itself, you will start on time like normal.
Five minutes before your discussion ends, I will ask you to leave the room, and I will take both positive feedback and constructive criticism from the class in the remaining five minutes.
I'll send you the feedback from the class and myself through email sometime after the observation.

#### Track B - CEE Workshop Attendance

The [Center for Educational Effectiveness](https://cee.ucdavis.edu/) (or CEE) promotes and supports effective learning for all UC Davis students.
You're probably already met them at TA orientation, if you've attended it.
CEE holds workshops every quarter on a variety of topics to help you improve your teaching.
This quarter's emphasis is on the foundations of teaching, which is perfect for first-time instructors.

Your assignment will be to attend a CEE workshop, and write a short paragraph on what you learned there.
The paragraph doesn't need to be very detailed, I'm just curious as to what you learned.
You can view all the available workshops on [CEE's website](https://ucdavis.app.box.com/s/t8irmknay76fgg1azpha1urf761fqt60).
Feel free to attend any one that strikes your fancy, though keep in mind some of the workshops are oriented towards faculty and not graduate students.

Note that you need to register ahead of time on each event's page.
When you submit your paragraph, also attach a screenshot of the registration confirmation email that you get from CEE.

## Schedule

See the [official schedule](./schedule.csv) on GitHub for the course schedule.
For more details on what we're going to cover each week, see the [seminar notes](../seminars/README.md).
