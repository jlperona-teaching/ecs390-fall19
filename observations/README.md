# Observations

These forms are intended for an observer to evaluate a TA.
The observer can then provide an electronic copy to the TA and any other interested parties, such as program staff.

## Observer Version

The version for the observer, `observer.pdf`, is intended to be printed out and filled during the observation itself.

## TA Version

The version for the TA, `ta.docx`, is intended to be filled in by the observer after the observation is done.
Once the notes are transcribed onto the document, a copy can be sent to the TA, among others.

As much as I dislike adding binary files to a Git repository, a .docx file is admittedly one of the easier ways to convert the written copy to an electronic one.
