# Week 10

This week concludes the course.
I'll bring up some of the topics mentioned in the previous week's homework; you'll then have one last chance to ask any questions that you have on topics that we've covered in the course.
I'll point out some other educational resources that may be helpful in your role as a TA.
Finally, we'll wrap things up and I'll ask for your feedback.

Some of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Bringing It All Back [5 min]

*Making connections to the rest of the course.*

### Assignment From Last Week

The assignment from last week asked you about topics that you'd like to discuss further, or to talk about things that you've learned or gotten better at over the course of this class.
We're going to spend the first part of this final class talking about answers to that first question: things to discuss further.

## Topics for Further Discussion [35 min]

*Guided discussion based on your responses to the previous homework.*

### Attendance

Before we continue any further, I will pass around a sign in sheet to each person.
Please write your name and student ID number down on your sign in sheet.
I will collect them at the end of class.

### Sexual Harassment

At the request of another instructor, I'm going to touch on this topic briefly.
You should have attended a mandatory workshop on sexual violence intervention and prevention (SVPT) as part of your enrollment process.
It was also talked about at TA Orientation—see [The TA's Guide to Effective Teaching at UC Davis](https://ucdavis.app.box.com/s/9w6xxlfuvfzeb8j5mnd787kbj0osiuav) by the [Center for Educational Effectiveness (CEE)](https://cee.ucdavis.edu/) for more information.

The ECE department has a very good section in their [TA Handbook](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/graduate/ta-handbook/interact/#sexual-harassment) on sexual harassment.
I'm going to focus on one point in particular, which is their examples of how instructors can misuse their power.
The examples that they wrote include:

* Asking a student for sexual favors in exchange for better grades, a recommendation, or other academic benefit.
* Asking a student personal questions which makes the student feel uncomfortable.
* Making personal jokes or comments about students.
* Pressuring student to spend time with them outside the academic setting, including urging a student to get romantically and/or sexually involved.
* Touching a student when and where the student doesn’t want to be touched. This could include hugging, grabbing, brushing against him or her, sitting or standing too close, and more.

An unequal power dynamic exists between a TA and a student.
Something which may not even seem coercive, such as asking a student for a social media username, can potentially be seen as coercive by a student depending on the context.
Keep that in mind when interacting with students.
Making friends with your students is completely fine.
Going past casual friends is potentially problematic.

### Further Topics

I will try my best to go through the following topics that you and your fellow students brought up in the last assignment.
Some of these topics honestly deserve classes of their own, but I'll try my best to touch on all of them.

* Emotional intelligence
    * Self-motivation and regulation
    * Separating your career from your personal life or "leaving it at the door"
    * Teaching emotional intelligence (explicitly or as a part of other topics)
    * Using emotional intelligence in the context of your teaching
* Issues working with your instructor and classmates
    * Combining the TA-student dynamic with social circles (lab, coworkers, etc.)
    * Instructor showing favoritism among TAs
    * Unresponsive instructor
* Teaching strategies
    * Best practice towards teaching different parts of computer science
    * Differences in teaching between cultures
    * Improving your teaching skills despite your workload or motivation towards what you're teaching
    * Pivoting your teaching style towards the newest generation of students

## Final Questions [if time]

*Lingering thoughts.*

### One Last Chance

If there's time, I'll ask for any remaining questions that you have.
It can be about topics that we've covered in this course, or something else that you'd like to bring up.

## Wrap Up [10 min]

*Wrapping everything up.*

### What You've Improved On

From the assignment from the previous week, people mentioned that they learned about the following topics:

* Duties of a TA (beyond leading discussion sections and grading)
* Educational tools
* Emotional intelligence and interacting with students (especially distressed or distressing students)
* Mindsets, how students learn, and differences between them
* Other resources to improve your teaching ability
* Presentation and lecture skills
* Teaching strategies and their contextuality
* Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and accessibility

I'm glad to see that people learned a variety of things from this course!

### Improving Never Ends

I hope that this class has introduced you to a new idea or given you the chance to improve some aspect of your teaching.
That said, this class shouldn't be the end of that journey.
You can *always* improve your teaching skills.
I'm constantly doing the same via learning from other instructors and trying new things, such as the adjustments to the curriculum for this class (twice!).

Even if you're not going to be an instructor after your time in graduate school, some of these skills could still prove useful to you out in industry or elsewhere.
If you do end up becoming an educator, I hope that you continue to hone your teaching ability wherever life takes you next.

### Thank You

Finally, thank you for attending this class and bearing with me over these past 10 weeks.
I'd love your constructive feedback on what you liked and what could be done better; more on that in a bit.

I make an offer to all my students at the end of this class.
If you're serious about improving your teaching, I'm willing to meet you halfway.
Feel free to email me in the future if you'd like to talk, want me to point you to some resources, or have me do an observation of one of your discussions (or even lectures!).
I can't promise that I'll be in Davis forever on that last one, but we can try to make it work.

## Assignment for This Week

*One last thing before you go.*

### Feedback

There are two sets of feedback to fill out to finish off the class.
Only one of them is going to be graded, though.

*Note that the homework for this week is due on Friday at 23:59.*
It's due before the start of finals so I can finalize the grades as quickly as possible.

#### Giving Good Feedback

In the spirit of this class being about improving your teaching ability, here's some resources about feedback from the [Students Assessing Teaching And Learning (SATAL) Program](https://cetl.ucmerced.edu/satal) from UC Merced.
Admittedly, this is for students rather than TAs or instructors, but I think it's useful for everyone.

The SATAL Program created [this useful rubric](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/jqitg8o5zp125/j7z56pnupw9461/jt0c3yml2fz2/shs_rubric.pdf) (also available on [Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6660862/download?download_frd=1)) on how to give useful feedback to instructors on their classes.
They've divided it into highly useful, somewhat useful, and not useful feedback that students can give to instructors to improve their courses and teaching.
There's also a three minute video [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-aaKMva4lc) if you prefer videos.

I'm not requiring you to read through the rubric or watch the video before you give me feedback, but I'd certainly appreciate it if you did.
It might even prove handy for you in future classes.

#### Feedback on the Curriculum

*This feedback will be graded, but only on completion.*

The [assignment on Canvas for this week](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372346) contains a link to a Google Form with the feedback.
The focus is on the curriculum, how you felt about it, and if there was anything that you felt I could have added.

As mentioned above, you will only be graded on completion.
As long as you submit the Google Form, you'll get credit, no matter your opinions.
I'd like for you to be honest in your feedback and let me know if this class was useful for you.
I will use this feedback to determine if I will continue to offer 390 in this format, and what changes I should make if I do.

#### Feedback for Me

*This feedback will not be graded.*

This set of feedback can be found on UC Davis' [Academic Course Evaluations](https://eval.ucdavis.edu/).
You'll probably get an email every single day that you still need to fill out feedback for any of your classes.
The focus is more on me and the class as a whole, rather than the curriculum itself.

As mentioned above, you won't be graded on this, and it's not mandatory.
Since it's completely anonymous, I can't grade you on it.
There's also no way for me to compel you to fill it out, but I ask that you do, and that you do so honestly.
I will use any positive and constructive feedback to help me determine how to make future classes better.
