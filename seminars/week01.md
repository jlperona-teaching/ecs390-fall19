# Week 1

Welcome to ECS 390, The Teaching of Computer Science.
This week is an introduction to the course.
I'll introduce myself, you'll introduce yourself to me and to other students, and I'll introduce the class.
After that, we'll talk about the different *hats* that TAs wear.

Some of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Introductions [20 min]

*Get to know each other a little bit better.*

### Facilitator Introduction

I'll introduce myself to the class.
So that you (hopefully) trust me and believe that I know what I'm doing, I'll go over my background and why I'm qualified to teach this class.

### Attendance

After I've introduced myself, I'd like for you to introduce yourself to me.
I will pass around half-page questionnaires that will serve as the attendance for today; please fill it out.
The questionnaire will ask you about:

* Your name
* Your degree objective
* How many years you have been in the program
* Your research focus
* A hobby of yours
* Something you hope to get out of this class

*Only I will know exactly what you marked.
I will not reveal your answers to anyone else.
What you answer will have no impact on your grade, as I am only grading on attendance.
You do not need to reveal your answers to anybody else in the next portion of the class if you do not wish to.*

### Student Introductions

Then, you'll introduce yourself to somebody next to you that you don't know.
The first day sets the tone for the rest of the course, so I need to get you used to talking so that you'll continue to participate.
You just filled out a sheet that has some great information to introduce yourself to other people.
You can use that to meet somebody new, if you'd like!

After we are done introducing ourselves, I will collect the questionnaires.
We will then move on to the next topic.

## Class Guidelines and Expectations [20 min]

*My plans and your hopes for this class.*

### What Can You Expect?

This is a TA training program, with a focus on creating an inclusive climate for all.
You can expect there to be a lot of discussion, and to be exposed to concepts you may not have seen before.
You can also expect this to be a safe space for you to communicate your experiences and ideas.

This is a relatively new curriculum, one which I've tried before and am now modifying to (hopefully) suit your needs better.
You can expect there to be some stumbles along the way.
I ask that you be patient with me and be open to trying new things.

### What Do I Expect of You?

Some of these expectations are adapted from Kathy Obear's [*Suggested List of Learning Guidelines*](https://drkathyobear.com/).

* *Listen respectfully.* Even if you disagree with somebody, seek to understand why they feel that way.
* *Be open to new and different perspectives.* Nobody should feel ostracized because their perspective is different from somebody else.
* *Respect and maintain confidentiality.* The wisdom you get from this class can leave the room, but people's words stay here.
* *Engage the opportunity!* You'll get the most out of this course if you participate.

### Course Overview

From there, we'll go over the course [syllabus](../syllabus/syllabus.md) and [schedule](../syllabus/schedule.csv).
I'll also introduce the course websites, the grading policy, and the assignments for this quarter.

## Purpose of TAs [10 min]

*What hats do TAs wear?*

### Discussion

To finish today, we'll have a brief discussion about the role of a TA.
This will provide context for next week's topic, which is about TA guidelines and responsibilities.

I'll ask what is the purpose and role of a TA.
There are a variety of *hats* that instructors wear over the course of their job, so I will ask you what hats you can think of.
From there, I'll let the conversation flow naturally.

### Common Responses

To finish our discussion, I will show this list of common responses to this question for computer science TAs; we will then discuss them.
This list isn't a definitive answer to the question, but these responses are certainly worth considering.

* TAs are there to help students who are struggling with a specific problem or bug.
* TAs are there to provide a resource for students who might not feel comfortable asking a professor for help.
* TAs are not there to provide students with answers.
* TAs are not there to tell students whether they belong in the class.

## Assignment for This Week

*Preparing for next week and beyond.*

### Discussion Leaders

On [Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850), you'll have an assignment every week.
The assignment is *usually* due at 15:00 on the following Monday.

For [this week's assignment](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372345), write down whether or not you're TAing this quarter, and if you're leading discussions.
It should take you a couple of minutes at most.
If you're not leading discussions, that's all you need to write.

If you are leading discussions, please give the class, days, times, and rooms that you're leading discussions in.
If you're not consistently leading discussions at the same time every week (because you're splitting that duty with someone else, or for any other reason) please also give the dates that you'll be leading discussions.

If you don't know because you are still discussing your duties with your instructor, please write that down as well.
I will contact you at a later date to confirm that information.

### Reading for Next Week

Also, read through *Teaching Tips We Wish They'd Told Us Before We Started* by Owen Astrachan, Nick Parlante, Daniel D. Garcia, and Stuart Reges.
This was originally published in the *ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education* in 2007.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6661006/download?download_frd=1).
This is a short 2-page paper about some teaching tips for new instructors.
While this is intended for professors and lecturers, some of these tips could be applicable in your role as a TA.

You don't need to write a summary or review for this paper.
However, I would like you to review it, as it has some good information.
It also ties into TA roles and responsibilities, which we will discuss further next week.
