# Week 5

**Under construction.**

## Initial Reflection About Learning [10 min]

*Think about how you, as a student, learn while in a class.*

### Brainstorming

After this, we're going to be talking about learning styles and strategies.
To get you in the proper mindset for the discussion, I want you to reflect on how you, as a *student* (not an instructor), learn.
You're a graduate student in computer science at UC Davis.
You needed to have done well at your previous institution to get here, so you have probably found a system that works for you.

Take out your preferred method of brainstorming.
I'll have some pens and some scratch paper up front if you need it, but you can also write on your laptop or phone if you think it's more conducive to brainstorming.
Write down your thoughts.
I'm not going to be collecting this, nor will you be graded on it.
This is solely for your benefit and to help guide the discussion that follows.

### Reflection Prompts

Here are some ways you can approach this reflection.
You aren't bound to these, so if you think of something else you'd like to write down that's relevant, feel free.

* How do I approach a new assignment? Do I make a plan? Do I start right away? Do I discuss it with anyone?
* What conditions make it easiest for me to do my homework? How often do I do my homework under these conditions?
* What do I do when I don't understand something or am struggling to complete an assignment? How does it make me feel?
* How long do I try to work something out on my own before asking for help? Where do I usually go for help?
* Do I always approach my schoolwork in the same way or do I try out different strategies? Do I approach different subjects in different ways?
* What motivates me to do my work? What does "doing well" in a class mean to me? How do I react when I don't do well?

## Talking About Learning [15 min]

*Come back together and talk about what you've reflected on.*

### Discussion

We will then talk about what we just reflected on.
There are no right answers to this; everybody has their own system that works for them.

### Prompts

At the start, I'll ask if anyone is willing to share what they've written down.
I'll share my own answers if the discussion permits.

From there, I'll allow the discussion to flow naturally.
If there's a lull, I'll ask the following, but we're not required to get to them all.

* Have you spent much time thinking about how you learn before? Or was this new?
* What kinds of things did you notice when you were reflecting?
* Were there any areas where what you thought you should be doing and what you actually do were different? Was that a difficult thing to admit?
* Are there any ways in which you think you learn differently than many others? What kinds of challenges do you think other people run into?

## Universal Design for Learning [25 min]

*Tying accessibility to inclusiveness.*

### Reading From Last Week

The reading from last week was all about UDL.
I'll ask for a short summary of the paper, akin to the first paragraph of your review.
In particular, I'll ask for the definition of UDL.
After that, I'll ask for any comments or questions on the reading.

### Examples

From there, we will go through some examples in the spirit of UDL.
These examples focus on improving the accessibility of classes and how that ties to the idea of inclusiveness.

#### Accessibility

Take some time to come up with examples of ways that classes can be more accessible to a wider variety of students.
I will write these on the board.

#### Impact

After we have come up with some examples to improve accessibility, we will go through each example in turn.
For each of these examples, think about the impact that each may have on how a student feels in a class.
I will write these impacts on the board as well.

#### Personal Experiences

The previous topic had to do with impacts on students in a classroom.
Now, think of times when you have benefited from something being more accessible, even though you didn't *need* it to be that way.
We will talk about these.

If you can't think of any examples, here are two of them:

* Using an elevator to travel less than 5 floors, if you're also able to use the stairs.
* Sending a text message rather than discussing in person.

### Wrap Up

Once we complete the topic, I will ask why we covered UDL today right after discussing how you as a student learn in a classroom.
There is a specific answer I am looking for, which is the one thing I hope that you take away from today.

Finally, I'll ask if anyone has any questions before we move on.

## Assignment for This Week

*What type of mindset do you have?*

### Logistics

*Note*: there is no class next Monday, 2019-11-04, due to the Veterans Day holiday.
You have two weeks to do this assignment, which is due on Monday, 2019-11-11 at 15:00.

### Reading

Read through *Mindset: The New Psychology of Success* by Carol Dweck of Stanford University.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6660990/download?download_frd=1).
Also, you should go through the two questionnaires and figure out what type of mindset you have for both intelligence and personality.
(If you're disappointed with the mindsets you got, re-read the last sentence of the chapter again.)

### Review

The review format is adapted from the format for the [paper reviews for ECS 201C](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS201C/blob/master/syllabus.md#paper-reviews) by Jason Lowe-Power.

Write a review of the reading above.
Your review should contain two short paragraphs:

1. A short summary of the reading, and any key insights or implications.
2. Your own thoughts about the reading. Anything that stood out or resonated with you, or a topic/question about it for next week.

Submit your review in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372350).

### Grading

I'm looking to see if you read the paper.
I am not going to grade this that harshly.
That being said, if it's clear from your review that you didn't read the paper, you may not receive full credit.
