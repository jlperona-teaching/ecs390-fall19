# Week 9

This week's focus is on emotional intelligence.
We started talking about emotional intelligence at the end of last week; the reading from last week went into further detail about it.
First, we will discuss how it applies to your work as a TA.
From there, we'll move into some examples to apply your newfound knowledge.

The majority of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Why Does Emotional Intelligence Matter? [20 min]

*Why should you care about emotional intelligence?*

### Reading From Last Week

To start the discussion for today, we will talk about the reading about emotional intelligence (EI) from last week.
I'll ask for a short summary of the reading, akin to the first paragraph of your review.
After that, I'll ask for any comments or questions on the reading.

### Discussion

From there, we will move into a discussion about the many ways that EI should be relevant to you as a TA.
We'll use this to give importance to the scenarios we'll talk about after this discussion.

### Prompts

I'll ask how you think emotional intelligence relates to your work as a TA.
It can also apply outside of the classroom and to your life as a whole.

From there, I'll allow the discussion to flow naturally.
We can also discuss any questions or thoughts you have about emotional intelligence.
If there's a lull, I'll ask the following, but we're not required to get to them all.

* Why do you think we're discussing EI in this training?
* How does EI impact your experience as a student?
* How will EI be important in your work as TAs?
* Looking back, can you think of any moments when you were negatively impacted by someone else being oblivious to your feelings and concerns?
* Can you think of any moments when someone seemed to genuinely understand your feelings better than you did in the moment? Were they able to help you?

## Emotional Intelligence Scenarios [30 min]

*Applying emotional intelligence to real-life scenarios.*

### Splitting Into Groups

For this exercise, we're going to split into groups of 3 to 4.
Rearrange yourselves so that you can all discuss with the other members of your group.

The three scenarios below will be shown on the projector.
Start with one scenario, and read through it.
Once everyone is done reading, respond to the discussion prompts for that scenario.
Once you're done with a scenario, move on to another one.
Plan to take about 5 minutes for each scenario.
I will announce when 5 and 10 minutes have passed; at that time, you should wrap up the discussion of your current scenario and move on to another one.

I will provide a piece of scratch paper and a pen to each group.
Each group will assign a scribe to write down their responses for each scenario.
*Make sure everybody writes down their names and student ID numbers on the scratch paper.
This is the sign-in sheet for today.
It will be collected, but I am not grading what you write.*

### Scenarios

#### Scenario 1

A student shows up late to an appointment they made with you for additional office hours.
They seem flustered and unfocused.
When you begin discussing some of the weak points in their assignment, they begin to cry.

#### Scenario 2

In office hours, a student gets increasingly frustrated when listening to your feedback on their recent work.
Eventually they have a hostile outburst, blaming your teaching skills for their difficulty with the assignments.

#### Scenario 3

A student appears to be less motivated and not taking the work as seriously.
When you meet with them in office hours, they make it clear that they do not feel challenged and can finish their work much faster than their classmates.

#### Discussion Prompts

There is not necessarily a single correct answer to any of these questions.
In particular, there is no correct answer to the second one.

* What factor might be contributing to this situation?
* How does this situation make you feel?
* What might be the best way to react?

### Coming Back Together

After 15 minutes, I will ask everybody to come back together.
For the remainder of the class, we will discuss each scenario.
I will ask everybody for observations about the scenarios that they'd like to share.
Depending on how the conversation flows, I may bring up my expectations of your behavior in each situation.

At the end of class, I will collect the papers that each group wrote on, as this is the attendance for today.
I will ask if anyone forgot to sign in.

## Assignment for This Week

*The beginning of the end.*

### Final Questions

The first part of the last class will be devoted to bringing it all back and answering any final questions that you may have about topics we covered.
If you have a question or topic that you'd like to discuss further at the beginning of the next class, write it down.
Otherwise, if you don't have a question or topic to discuss further, write down something you've learned or gotten better at over the course of this class.
*I will keep your responses anonymous, but I will use these as a talking point next time we meet.*

Submit your question or response in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372353).

### Grading

As long as you respond to the question(s) appropriately, you'll get credit.
