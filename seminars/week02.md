# Week 2

This week's focus is on your responsibilities as a TA.
We'll discuss some guidelines and responsibilities for being a TA in CS at UC Davis.
We will also have a presentation from the UC Student-Workers Union, UAW 2865.

## Teaching Assistant Guidelines and Responsibilities [30 min]

*Guidance for teaching CS at UC Davis.*

### Poll

Before we continue, I want to see how many students have been or are currently TAs.
Interestingly enough, this information (particularly on whether you've TAed in the past) isn't easily available, even to someone who is teaching a TA training course!
I'll use the results to this question to tailor the next section appropriately.

I will pass around a questionnaire to each person that will look like previous ballots in the class.
Please write your name on the questionnaire, as this will serve as the sign in sheet for today.
There will be one question on the questionnaire.
Please mark *Yes* or *No* on the questionnaire in response to the following question:

> Have you been or are you currently a TA here at UC Davis?

*Only I will know exactly what you marked.
I will not reveal your specific choice to anyone else, though I will reveal the results in the aggregate to further the discussion.
What you mark will have no impact on your grade, as I am only grading on attendance.*

Afterwards, I will collect the questionnaire and count them.
When I have finished counting, I will reveal the results in the aggregate.

### Notes

Now that we have some context, we're going to go over some guidelines and responsibilities for teaching CS here at UC Davis.
This was originally developed by Sean Davis, who was a long-time lecturer here before retiring a couple of years ago (though you might see him around next quarter).
I took his version of this and added some of my own observations and notes to it.
You can find the PDF version of it [here on GitHub](../notes/teaching-guidelines-responsibilities.pdf).

Going over the entire document would probably take a couple of hours.
Instead, we're going to go over points that I think are particularly important, which are **bolded** in the document.

## Union Presentation [20 min]

Afterwards, we will have a brief presentation from [UAW 2865](https://uaw2865.org/), the union for academic student employees in the UC system.

**Under construction.**

*Note*: I work with the department that employs you in addition to being the instructor for this class.
It is against federal law for me to coerce you to join the union.
*Deciding to join the union or not has absolutely no impact on your grade in this class, nor with your employment status with the Department of Computer Science*.

## Assignment for This Week

*Tools and other technology to make your teaching more effective.*

### Reading

Read through *Technology We Can't Live Without!, revisited* by Ria Galanos, Michael Ball, John Dougherty, Joe Hummel, and David J. Malan.
This was originally published in the *ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education* in 2018.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6661077/download?download_frd=1).
This is a short 2-page paper about tools used in computer science education.
The presentation next week will talk about some tools in use at UC Davis, and we'll have a discussion if there's time.

### Questions

You don't need to write a formal review of the paper.
Instead, answer the following three questions:

1. Have you used, or are currently using, any of the educational tools that the authors mentioned?
2. Are there any tools on this list that you haven't used that may be useful to you in the future?
3. Are there any tools *not* on this list that you think are worth mentioning?

Submit your responses in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310492).

### Grading

As long as you respond to the questions appropriately, you'll get credit.
