# Week 3

This week's focus is on educational tools, particularly those used in CS education here at UC Davis.
We will have a faculty presenter here to talk about tools that he's used.
If there's time, then we will have a longer discussion on these tools.

## Faculty Presentation

*Advice from somebody who's been doing this for a while.*

### Presenter

**Under construction.**

### Attendance

After the introduction, I will pass around a sign in sheet to each person.
Please write your name down on your sign in sheet.
I will collect them at the end of class.

## Educational Tools [if time]

*Discussing the use of educational tools and their impact on students.*

### Discussion

If we have some time left over after the presentation, we will segue into a conversation about educational tools.
I'd love to hear about the tools you're currently using and what you think works well in your classes.
I'd also like to hear about what you think *doesn't* work well in your classes.

We can also talk about other tools that didn't show up on in the paper.
There's plenty of them, but some of the ones I've heard of include [*Mimir*](https://www.mimirhq.com/), [*GitHub Education*](https://education.github.com/) (different than the way I use GitHub for this class), [*zyBooks*](https://www.zybooks.com/), [*Kodethon*](https://www.kodethon.com/#/), and others.

## Assignment for This Week
