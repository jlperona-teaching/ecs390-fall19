# Week 3

This week's focus is on educational tools, particularly those used in CS education here at UC Davis.
We will have a presenter here to talk about the various educational tools that they have used.
If there's time, then we will have a longer discussion on these tools.

## Faculty Presentation

*Advice from somebody who's been doing this for a while.*

### Presenter

Our presenter this week is [Aakash Prabhu](http://aakprabhu.com/), a first-year PhD student here in the Department of Computer Science.
If his name sounds familiar, it might be because I made an announcement about the [CERD seminar](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/discussion_topics/358735) that he's co-leading with me.
He's been a long time TA here at UC Davis, and will be teaching his own class in Spring Quarter.
While I've been teaching slightly longer than he has, he's been the one to introduce me to some of the tools that I'm currently using today, which brings up an important point: *some of the best ways to improve your teaching is via your peers*.

Aakash will talk about and demo the following tools that he's used:

* [*Gradescope*](https://www.gradescope.com/)
* [*Piazza*](https://piazza.com/)
* [*RMarkdown*](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
* [*Jupyter Notebook*](https://jupyter.org/)
* [*NBGrader*](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader)

### Attendance

After the introduction, I will pass around a sign in sheet to each person.
Please write your name and student ID number down on your sign in sheet.
I will collect them at the end of class.

## Educational Tools [if time]

*Discussing the use of educational tools and their impact on students.*

### Discussion

If we have some time left over after the presentation, we will segue into a conversation about educational tools.
I'd love to hear about the tools you're currently using and what you think works well in your classes.
I'd also like to hear about what you think *doesn't* work well in your classes.

We can also talk about other tools that didn't show up on in the paper.
There's plenty of them, but some of the ones I've heard of include:

* [*GitHub Education*](https://education.github.com/) (note: this is different than the way I use GitHub for this class)
* [*Kodethon*](https://www.kodethon.com/#/)
* [*Mimir*](https://www.mimirhq.com/)
* [*Plickers*](https://www.plickers.com/)
* [*zyBooks*](https://www.zybooks.com/)

## Assignment for This Week

*Preparing for your small-group presentation next week.*

### Background

Next week's class will involve you giving a five-minute presentation (along with time at the end to answer a question from everyone) in front of a group of four to five of your fellow students in the class.
The topic is completely up to you, though I ask that you keep it appropriate for a classroom environment.
The people in your group will be giving anonymous feedback about your presentation.
You will in turn give anonymous feedback about the presentations of the members of your group.
Note that you won't have a projector or a board to use, so you'll need to present without those things.

If you remember from [last week's class](./week02.md), I said that I would spend two to three hours preparing for a single hour of lecture.
Writing this document up was no exception.
I'm not expecting you to spend two to three hours preparing for this presentation, but I am expecting you to put some time in to prepare beforehand.

### Assignment

In the spirit of the above, tell me the topic that you are planning on presenting.
Submit your topic in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372348).
This is all you need to submit on Canvas for this week.

You will also need to put together a set of presentation notes or aids to help you present.
I'm not mandating the style of notes that you put together.
You can use bullet points, flash cards, lecture notes, or any other method that will help you present.
*You do not need to submit these on Canvas for this week's assignment, but I will collect them after your presentation next week.*

Make sure you prepare for your presentation.
The best way to do so is to practice by speaking out loud!
I will sometimes do a practice presentation two or three times to work out all the kinks.
*If it's clear from your group's feedback that you were not prepared to present, you may not receive credit for attendance next week.*

### Grading

You will get credit for this week's assignment as long as you submit your topic by the due date.
Regarding attendance for next week, you will get credit if you do the following:

* make a good-faith effort on your presentation (as determined by your group's feedback).
* turn in your filled-in feedback form (passed out in class next week).
* turn in your presentation notes that you used for the presentation (make sure to write your name down on your notes).
