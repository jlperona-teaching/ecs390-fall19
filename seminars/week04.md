# Week 4

This week's class involves you giving a presentation in front of a small group of your fellow students.
The people in your group will be giving you anonymous feedback about your presentation.
You, in turn, will give anonymous feedback about the presentations by the other members of your group.

## Small-Group Presentations [50 min]

*Practicing your ability to speak in front of other people.*

### Background

In the past, ECS 390 was primarily presentation-based.
It used to be that one student presented in front of the rest of the class, emulating a real discussion section.
However, this takes a significant amount of time for everybody to have even a small bit of time to present.
With the increase in the number of students who want to take this class (as indicated by the waitlist sizes) it would take a significant amount of class meetings to keep doing this.

Instead, you will present in front of a smaller group.
The topic can be about whatever you like, so long as it's appropriate for the classroom setting.
This unfortunately doesn't allow us to emulate what a real discussion section would feel like, but it still lets you practice your presentation skills.
Some students have had plenty of teaching experience before and thus plenty of experience with presentations.
On the other hand, some students have had not gotten the chance to present in front of a crowd before.
Either way, you will get some more practice today, and hopefully the feedback from your groupmates will help you improve your presentation skills.

### Preparation

As noted in the [assignment from the previous week](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372348), I want you to prepare for this presentation.
That assignment asked you what you planned on presenting.
In addition to that, you need to have prepared a set of presentation notes or aids to help you present.
As I mentioned in the [presentation notes from week 2](../notes/teaching-guidelines-responsibilities.pdf), you should never go into a discussion unprepared.
The same applies here.

*You will not receive credit for attendance this week if you don't turn in your presentation notes or if you didn't make a good-faith effort on your presentation.*

#### Presentation Notes

I am not mandating the style of notes that you use, nor their length.
Everybody has a different method that they like to use to help them present; few people can truly "wing" a presentation well without notes.
For example, the notes you are reading now are long-form and are written to be student-facing, but I still use them as a presentation aid in class.
On the other hand, my notes for when I am teaching a traditional lecture (such as [these notes](https://github.com/jlperona-teaching/ecs154a-ssii18/blob/master/notes/1.14.pdf) from when I taught ECS 154A) are shorter and are designed for me, but also readable by students.
You can use whatever style works for you: bullet points, flash cards, or any other method that helps you present.

#### Practicing

I also want you to have prepared for the presentation.
The best way to do so is by speaking out loud and actually going through your presentation.
I will sometimes do a practice presentation two or three times to test it out.
If I catch something, I'll edit my notes and repeat it again until I'm happy with how things turned out.
You should practice your presentation at least once before class.

### Your Presentation

Your presentation should take around 4-5 minutes.

**Under construction.**

### Feedback for Others

Before we start the presentations, I will pass out a feedback form to everyone.

**Under construction.**

### Attendance and Returning Feedback

At the end of the class, I will collect everyone's feedback forms and presentation notes.
You will receive credit for attendance this week if you did the following:

* make a good-faith effort on your presentation (as determined by your group's feedback).
* turn in your filled-in feedback form (passed out at the beginning of class).
* turn in your presentation notes that you used for the presentation (make sure to write your name down on your notes).

Your feedback will remain anonymous as long as you didn't write your name down on the individual feedback sections.
You might have noticed that the feedback form was divided into sections and that I asked for your name at the top.
Your name is for attendance for this week.
I will separate all your filled feedback sections out from your name, group each feedback section by person, and return each person's feedback next week.

## Assignment for This Week

*Introducing the concept of Universal Design for Learning.*

### Reading

Read through *Universal Design: Implications for Computing Education* by Sheryl Burgstahler of the University of Washington, Seattle.
This was originally published in *ACM Transactions on Computing Education* in 2011.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6661078/download?download_frd=1).
We will discuss the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) next week.

### Review

The review format is adapted from the format for the [paper reviews for ECS 201C](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS201C/blob/master/syllabus.md#paper-reviews) by Jason Lowe-Power.

Write a review of the reading above.
Your review should contain two short paragraphs:

1. A short summary of the reading, and any key insights or implications.
2. Your own thoughts about the reading. Anything that stood out or resonated with you, or a topic/question about it for next week.

Submit your review in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372349).

### Grading

I'm looking to see if you read the paper.
I am not going to grade this that harshly.
That being said, if it's clear from your review that you didn't read the paper, you may not receive full credit.
