# Week 8

This week's focus is on criticism and feedback.
We will talk about how to deliver criticism and what constitutes effective feedback, and tie that to the reading from last week.
Finally, we will segue into a short introduction to emotional intelligence, which we will cover in more detail next week.

The majority of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Criticism and Tone [15 min]

*How your method of delivering information matters.*

### Reading From Last Week

To start this topic, we will talk about the paper reading from last week.
I'll ask about what its insights were on feedback, and if the authors mentioned anything about tone.
After that, I'll ask for any comments or questions on the reading.

### Slides

Next, we'll go through some slides on effective feedback.
You can find these slides in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6660864/download?download_frd=1).
These slides were adapted from ones provided by the *MaGE* Program.

After we go through the slides, I will ask for any questions about what we just talked about.

## Discussing Effective Feedback [25 min]

*What do you think makes feedback effective?*

### Poll

Now that we have covered a bit about tone, let's move to a discussion about your experiences with feedback.

I will pass around a questionnaire to each person.
Please write your name on the questionnaire, as this will serve as the sign in sheet for today.
There will be one question on the questionnaire.
Please mark *Yes* or *No* on the questionnaire in response to the following question:

> Have you ever had a negative experience with receiving feedback from somebody else?

*Only I will know exactly what you marked.
I will not reveal your specific choice to anyone else, though I will reveal the results in the aggregate to further the discussion.
What you mark will have no impact on your grade, as I am only grading on attendance.*

Afterwards, I will collect the questionnaire and count them.
When I have finished counting, I will reveal the results in the aggregate.

### Discussion

After the poll, we will discuss your interactions and feelings about feedback.
As a TA, part of your role may be giving feedback to students via grading, so if you serve in that capacity, you will influence the learning experiences that your students will have.

### Prompts

I'll ask how feedback has affected you personally.
It can be good or bad.
You can also talk about how it impacted you at the time, or how you feel when you think back on it.

From there, I'll allow the discussion to flow naturally.
I'll share my own experiences with feedback and criticism, if the discussion permits.
If there's a lull, I'll ask the following, but we're not required to get to them all.

* Can you think of any moment when someone gave you very "unbuffered" feedback? How did it make you feel? What impact did it have on you going forward?
* Can you think of any moments when it was easy for you to receive criticism? Why do you think it was easy?
* What kind of feedback from instructors do you find most helpful? Is there a particular format that works better for you?

### Further Reading

These examples were provided to me by Jason Lowe-Power of UC Davis.

[This feedback rubric](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6660862/download?download_frd=1) from the [Students Assessing Teaching And Learning (SATAL) Program](https://cetl.ucmerced.edu/satal) from UC Merced provides some useful examples of what is useful feedback, and what isn't.
You can also look at [this 3 minute video on the same topic on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-aaKMva4lc) from the SATAL Program as well.

## What is Emotional Intelligence [10 min]

*A brief introduction to emotional intelligence.*

### Introduction

I'll ask if anybody has heard of emotional intelligence (EI) before.
We'll have a brief discussion about what we think it means.

### Slides

To finish today, we will go through some slides on EI.
You can find these slides in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6660863/download?download_frd=1).
These slides were adapted from ones provided by the *MaGE* Program.

After we go through the slides, I will ask for any questions about what we just talked about.

## Assignment for This Week

*Furthering your understanding of emotional intelligence.*

### Reading

Read through Chapter 3 of *Emotional Intelligence* by Daniel Goleman.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6660881/download?download_frd=1).
We started discussing emotional intelligence at the end of today, and we will finish discussing it next week.

### Review

The review format is adapted from the format for the [paper reviews for ECS 201C](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS201C/blob/master/syllabus.md#paper-reviews) by Jason Lowe-Power.

Write a review of the reading above.
Your review should contain two short paragraphs:

1. A short summary of the reading, and any key insights or implications.
2. Your own thoughts about the reading. Anything that stood out or resonated with you, or a topic/question about it for next week.

Submit your review in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372352).

### Grading

I'm looking to see if you read the paper.
I am not going to grade this that harshly.
That being said, if it's clear from your review that you didn't read the paper, you may not receive full credit.
