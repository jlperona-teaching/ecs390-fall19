# Week 6

This week's focus is all about mindset and self-efficacy.
The assignment due today should have given you an idea about mindset and some insight into what your mindset is.
We'll explore that topic further and introduce the idea of self-efficacy today.

The majority of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Mindset and Self-Efficacy Introduction [10 min]

*Common language and terms for the remainder of today.*

### Mindset

We will cover the concept of *mindset* first.

#### Reading From Last Week

Before we continue, I'll ask for someone to share what they think mindset is, and the different types of mindsets.

If you haven't already determined what your mindset is, I'd suggest going back and reading the assigned reading from last week.
I would have liked to let you do so here, but there's quite a bit of content we need to cover today.

#### Definition

This definition is taken from [slides provided by the *MaGE* Program](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1odO7a3DbPxb8VsdsdlPDSUVMXvmCt-ANPWxcdCjT_-U).

There are two types of mindsets, *fixed* and *growth*.
Those who have a fixed mindset believe that:

* Your basic qualities, like intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits.
* You should document your intelligence or talent instead of developing them.
* This mindset means talent alone creates success, without effort.

Those who have a growth mindset believe that:

* Your basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.
* Brains and talent are just the starting point.
* This mindset creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.

Keep in mind that your mindset isn't fixed.
As the last sentence of the reading from last week states, you *can* change your mindset.

### Self-Efficacy

After our mindset discussion, I'll introduce the concept of *self-efficacy*.

#### Video

Before we dive into the definition, we're going to watch a student video explaining it.
This video is [available on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6660865/download?download_frd=1).
I believe that this video was made by a former student in the *MaGE* Program, but I'm not completely certain.

#### Definition

This definition is taken from [slides provided by the *MaGE* Program](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1odO7a3DbPxb8VsdsdlPDSUVMXvmCt-ANPWxcdCjT_-U).

Self-efficacy is the belief in your own ability to succeed in achieving a goal.
The higher your self-efficacy is, the more you believe you are capable of accomplishing a task.
People are less likely to attempt something with their full effort if their self-efficacy is lower for that task, because people tend to only try things that they believe they will be successful in.

## Mindset and Self-Efficacy Scenarios [25 min]

*Concrete examples of how mindset and self-efficacy matter.*

### Splitting into Groups

For this exercise, we're going to split into groups of 3 to 4.
Rearrange yourselves so that you can all discuss with each other.

Read through the first scenario, which will be shown on the projector.
Once everyone is done reading, respond to the discussion prompts below.
Once you're done with the first scenario, proceed to the second one.
I will announce when 7.5 minutes have passed; at that time, you should move on to discussion the second scenario.

I will provide a piece of scratch paper and a pen to each group.
Each group will assign a scribe to write down their responses to each question.
*Make sure everybody writes down their names on the scratch paper.
This is the sign-in sheet for today.
It will be collected, but I am not grading what you write.*

### Scenario 1

#### Description

It is almost 2 weeks into the quarter, just before the drop deadline, and a mentee says, "I suck at CS.
My code always has bugs, I'm spending hours in the CSIF waiting for help from the TAs, and then the TAs can't even fix it."
Their mentor says, "It's okay, not everyone is good at CS."
The mentee continues, "I was really excited about learning to program, but now I think I should just give up."
The mentor responds by saying, "Yeah, this assignment is pretty easy; I didn't need help when I did it in my undergrad here.
Maybe you should think about dropping the course and taking something that you're good at instead?"

#### Discussion Prompts

* Does the mentee's self-efficacy accurately reflect their ability? What mindsets are the mentee and mentor displaying? What cues indicate this?
* How do self-efficacy and mindset intersect in this scenario?
* How could the mentor respond differently to the mentee to cultivate effective learning?

### Scenario 2

#### Description

A mentee shows up to lab and immediately asks for assistance.
When the mentor comes over to help, the mentee says, "I don't know what this lab is about. Can you tell me what to do?"
The mentor asks if they've read the instructions, and the mentee responds, "Not really.
I'm not good with computers.
I know I won't be able to understand what's really going on, but I just need enough help to get through this."

#### Discussion Prompts

* Does the mentee have a fixed or growth mindset about computer science? What level of self-efficacy do they have for computer science? How is this impacting their approach to learning?
* What is the relationship between the mentee's mindset and level of self-efficacy?
* If you were the mentor in this scenario, how would you respond?

### Coming Back Together

After 15 minutes, I will ask everybody to come back together.
For the remaining 10 minutes, we will go through both scenarios.
I will ask groups to share what they wrote down in response to the prompts.

At the end of this topic, I will collect the papers that each group wrote on, as this is the attendance for today.
I will ask if anyone forgot to sign in.

## General Discussion on Mindset and Self-Efficacy [15 min]

*Share your thoughts and ask any questions you may have.*

### Discussion

After we have gone through the scenarios, we'll discuss what we've covered today.
We'll do so for the remainder of the class.

### Prompts

I'll ask for any thoughts or questions that you have as we've gotten more familiar with mindsets and self-efficacy.
I'll share my own thoughts about how it relates to my life and how I think about learning, if the discussion permits.

From there, I'll allow the discussion to flow naturally.
If there's a lull, I'll ask the following, but we're not required to get to them all.

* Has this changed the way you think about your own abilities at all?
* Can you think of any moments in your life when things would have gone very differently if you'd had more of a growth mindset about something?
* What do you think is the relationship between mindset and self-efficacy?
* Why are mindset and self-efficacy important to keep in mind when working with introductory-level students?

## Assignment for This Week

*What constitutes good feedback?*

### Logistics

*Note*: there is no class next Monday, 2019-11-11, due to the Veterans Day holiday.
You have two weeks to do this assignment, which is due on Monday, 2019-11-18 at 15:00.

### Reading

Read through *Do students value feedback? Student perceptions of tutorsâ€™ written responses* by Melanie R. Weaver of Nottingham Trent University.
This was originally published in *Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education* in 2006.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/6660904/download?download_frd=1).
This leads into next week's material, where we will discuss feedback and what makes it effective.

### Review

The review format is adapted from the format for the [paper reviews for ECS 201C](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS201C/blob/master/syllabus.md#paper-reviews) by Jason Lowe-Power.

Write a review of the reading above.
Your review should contain two short paragraphs:

1. A short summary of the reading, and any key insights or implications.
2. Your own thoughts about the reading. Anything that stood out or resonated with you, or a topic/question about it for next week.

Submit your review in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/369850/assignments/372351).

### Grading

I'm looking to see if you read the paper.
I am not going to grade this that harshly.
That being said, if it's clear from your review that you didn't read the paper, you may not receive full credit.
